abstract = {Serratia marcescens is an opportunistic human pathogen that represents a growing problem for public health, particularly in hospitalized or immunocompromised patients. However, little is known about factors and mechanisms that contribute to S. marcescens pathogenesis within its host. In this work, we explore the invasion process of this opportunistic pathogen to epithelial cells. We demonstrate that once internalized, Serratia is able not only to persist but also to multiply inside a large membrane-bound compartment. This structure displays autophagic-like features, acquiring LC3 and Rab7, markers described to be recruited throughout the progression of antibacterial autophagy. The majority of the autophagic-like vacuoles in which Serratia resides and proliferates are non-acidic and have no degradative properties, indicating that the bacteria are capable to either delay or prevent fusion with lysosomal compartments, altering the expected progression of autophagosome maturation. In addition, our results demonstrate that Serratia triggers a non-canonical autophagic process before internalization. These findings reveal that S. marcescens is able to manipulate the autophagic traffic, generating a suitable niche for survival and proliferation inside the host cell.},

@article{Ratkowsky1982,
abstract = {The Arrhenius Law, which was originally proposed to describe the temperature dependence of the specific reaction rate constant in chemical reactions, does not adequately describe the effect of temperature on bacterial growth. Microbiologists have attempted to apply a modified version of this law to bacterial growth by replacing the reaction rate constant by the growth rate constant, but the modified law relationship fits data poorly, as graphs of the logarithm of the growth rate constant against reciprocal absolute temperature result in curves rather than straight lines. Instead, a linear relationship between in square root of growth rate constant (r) and temperature (T), namely, square root = b (T - T0), where b is the regression coefficient and T0 is a hypothetical temperature which is an intrinsic property of the organism, is proposed and found to apply to the growth of a wide range of bacteria. The relationship is also applicable to nucleotide breakdown and to the growth of yeast and molds.},

@article{Fenchel1980,
abstract = {The quantitative uptake of suspended particles has been studied in 14 species of ciliated protozoa in terms of the maximum rate of water cleared at low particle concentrations and of the maximum ingestion rate at high particle concentrations. The results, supported by data from the literature, show that ciliates which feed on larger particles ({\textgreater} 1–5mgrm) compare favorably with metazoan suspension feeders with respect to the ability to concentrate dilute suspensions of particles. Species specialized on smaller food particles (0.2–1mgrm), the size range of most bacteria in natural environments, require a higher concentration of particles. Bacterial population densities which can sustain ciliate growth are found in sediments, waters rich in organic material, and in the early successional stages of decomposing organic material. This is not the case in open waters in general where bacterivorous ciliates cannot play a role as grazers of bacteria.},
